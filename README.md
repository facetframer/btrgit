# btrgit

Interact with [btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) snapshots made with [snapper](http://snapper.io/documentation.html) in a manner reminiscent of `git`.

Search for changes to files and restore old versions of files. Output is designed to be useable by other command line tools.

# Alternatives and prior work

- https://github.com/sysnux/btrfs-snapshots-diff.git
- `snapper` provides similar features but requires you to specify versiosn (and use snapper)

Influenced by `git`

# Caveats

- This approach uses `btrfs subvolumes find-new`, there is an alternative approach using `btrfs receive`.
- If you read this code you might object to the shell one-liners it contains. These hep fast development.
