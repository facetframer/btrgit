Like `git log` for btrfs snapshots. Homogenous output that is easy to grep (unlike git :P)

# Alternatives and prior work

- https://github.com/sysnux/btrfs-snapshots-diff.git
- `snapper` provides similar features but requires you to specify versiosn (and use snapper)

Influenced by `git`

# Caveats

- This approach uses `btrfs subvolumes find-new`, there is an alternative approach using `btrfs receive`.
- If you read this code you might object to the shell one-liners it contains. These hep fast development.
